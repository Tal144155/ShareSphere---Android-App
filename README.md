# Share Sphere App
![ic_logo.png](media/ic_logo.png)
The Share Sphere App is a social media platform that allows users to share posts and interact with each other.
This README file provides an overview of the app's features and functionalities.

**IMPORTANT**
Due to the app's difficulty loading large photos, when running the server, the database will be initialized with previously created posts and users. However, some of these images are quite large. To prevent the app from crashing, please log in with either the users "tal144155" or "yael2023". If attempting to access another user's profile page, please ensure to navigate to one of these accounts rather than others like "noy", as this profile contains heavy images. **Thank you for your cooperation! üòÅüôè**

## Features
### Sign up
It is important to sign up with the username: **alice** !
Otherwise you won't be able to see any of the hard-coded posts in the Profile.

### Feed
After logging in, users are redirected to the feed where they can view posts from other users.
Clicking on a profile picture redirects the user to the respective profile.

### Profile
Accessible by clicking on the profile picture.
Users can view their own posts and edit or delete them.

### Editing and Deleting Posts
Editing and deleting posts can only be done through the user's profile, where only their posts are displayed.

### Log out
Logging out can be done through the menu, by clicking on the button below.

### Creating a Post
Creating a post can be done through the profile, by clicking twice on the text box labeled "Share your thoughts".
A user should upload a picture and write some content in order to create a post.

## **Please notice:** The server and React components includes the option to add comments to posts. This feature is not currently available on the Android app, so refrain from pressing the comment button.
